        "# Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?  \n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes to improve modularity and reusability.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is a class in OOP?  \n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes (data) and methods (functions).  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is an object in OOP?  \n",
        "An object is an instance of a class that has specific values for the attributes defined in the class.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?  \n",
        "Abstraction hides implementation details from users, while encapsulation restricts access to data using access modifiers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?  \n",
        "Dunder methods (like `__init__`, `__str__`) are special methods with double underscores used for operator overloading and object behavior customization.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.  \n",
        "Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?  \n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same parent class through method overriding or overloading.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?  \n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by using private (`__var`) and protected (`_var`) attributes and methods to restrict access.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is a constructor in Python?  \n",
        "A constructor (`__init__` method) is automatically called when an object is created, initializing its attributes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What are class and static methods in Python?  \n",
        "Class methods (`@classmethod`) operate on class-level attributes, while static methods (`@staticmethod`) are independent of class and instance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is method overloading in Python?  \n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading, but function overloading can be mimicked using default parameters.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What is method overriding in OOP?  \n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is a property decorator in Python?  \n",
        "The `@property` decorator allows defining getter, setter, and deleter methods to control access to an attribute.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?  \n",
        "Polymorphism increases flexibility by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably without modifying the code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is an abstract class in Python?  \n",
        "An abstract class (using `ABC` module) cannot be instantiated and serves as a template for derived classes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. What are the advantages of OOP?  \n",
        "OOP improves code organization, reusability, scalability, security, and maintainability.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?  \n",
        "A class variable is shared among all instances, while an instance variable is unique to each object.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?  \n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.  \n",
        "`__str__` returns a user-friendly string representation, while `__repr__` provides an unambiguous string for debugging.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?  \n",
        "`super()` allows access to methods from a parent class, helping with inheritance and avoiding redundancy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. What is the significance of the `del` method in Python?  \n",
        "The `__del__` method is a destructor that is called when an object is deleted to free resources.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?  \n",
        "A static method doesnâ€™t access class or instance attributes, while a class method operates on the class itself.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?  \n",
        "Polymorphism allows child classes to override parent class methods, enabling different behaviors with the same interface.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?  \n",
        "Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on an object sequentially by returning `self` in each method.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?  \n",
        "The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n"
